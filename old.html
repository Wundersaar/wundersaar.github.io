  	<p>
	Queen of the Innuendolls<br><br>
	The poster of the first edition of the Innuendo International Film Festival in Milan.<br>
	The cover is actually a gem and I’ll explain why: the photo was taken in my room at the Queen Hotel located in the main square of Eindhoven where I was hosted as a participant in the documentary festival DocFeed. So, a poster for a 	festival born from a real experience at a festival. Then there is the name, Queen, just like the band of Freddy Mercury, those who have immortalized the term “innuendo” in pop-rock memory, in a substratum of this however not trivial 	but rather of social denunciation, of that end as it goes to highlight phenomena hidden under the heavy hood of connivance typical of social labeling.<br><br>

	<h3>Goats On The Left</h3>

  	<p>	
	“Goats on the left”, since “goats just want to have fun”, so says the Bible and so says Cyndi Lauper!”Some philosophers further declared that there were two methods of writing: one from left to right, which was considered the exoteric 	method; the other from right to left, which was considered esoteric. The exoteric writing was that which was done out or away from the heart, while the esoteric writing was that which — like the ancient Hebrew — was written toward the 	heart.” – Manly P. Hall, The Secret Teachings of All Ages<br><br>

Above right in the GIF a print signed by Andrea Pazienza in 1983. This print, now in my Genoese tiny loft, has been a cipher and imprint of my apartment in Via Filzi 10 in Milan, i.e. my beloved and envied loft with a very strange heritage I inherited in spite of myself – the engineer who rented the studio to me died suddenly in the mountains during a climbing in Switzerland, where he lived with his new younger companion he had his house in usufruct until his death, a legacy of his wife to whom he had survived and which would then be handed over to a famous Milanese medical institution, which had lent palliative care to the lady in her last days. A sad, pining and melancholic story, but very beautiful, painful and romantic, at least in one direction.<br>
The emblazoned Milanese medical institution made a use that could not have been worse: after denying me and my roommates a slight lowering of the rent, with the result that we had to go – I resolved to move around, away from Milan, at the time my heart beat for Berlin, so I relocated there, definitively, or at least that was what I thought. One time I returned to Milan for a medical issue, I already hadn’t lived there for three months, but with my rucksack on the very early morning once got off from the night train from Stuttgart I went there like a sleep-walker and for a time resembling hours and hours, under the closed windows of the mezzanine that had been my dwelling.
<br><br>
Pazienza’s print was displayed in the studio between the two windows, the same ones that I was now starring at from the outside. But the press, on my return from Stuttgart, had fortunately already been rescued from the neglect typical of 90% of Italian institutions, not only public – otherwise it would be remained in the apartment now closed for 15 years, what for a blamable behaviour – so that when I look at it now hanging on another wall and in another city I remember myself of those super beautiful years with cheerful nostalgia. I believe that it is representation itself, the vignette that makes nostalgia less bitter-sweet and more peppery. Thanks Paz.

Zanardi is a fictional comic book character created by Andrea Pazienza (1956-1988) and the protagonist of a series of comic stories made in the eighties. He debuted in 1981 in the magazine Frigidaire. A perfidious and amoral high school student, he became representative of the generation of young Italians in the early 1980s. Massimo Zanardi, known as Zanna, is a tall, thin young boy with an aquiline nose, blue eyes – with a cold and impassive look – and blond hair with a pronounced tuft, a repeating student at the Bologna high school during the early 1980s; in the first stories he is 21 years old while in the last he claims to be 23; he is extremely cynical and evil, without scruples or values; makes use of all kinds of drugs. He has friends: Roberto Colasanti known as Colas and Sergino Petrilli known as Pietra. He has committed a long series of reprehensible acts, from theft to murder; he is fatherless and has a sister. Drive a black Golf. Pazienza himself said of the character, in an interview: «Zanardi’s main characteristic is emptiness. The absolute emptiness that permeates every action “.

	A fair dedicated to perfumes in Milan, a fun fair for me, where to lose yourself in indescribable scents, everywhere fair colors as well as intense, likewise the fragrances, lusty, adulterated, undiluted, evaporated; lost myself in the 	array, the same awake and in a trance state of mind of vigorous, lively and focused reverie, a treasure hunt, so much impalpable beauty. Scents as a lift from earth to heaven and return to earthy, dirty.<br><br>

	<h3>(cat-à-rifrangente)</h3>

  	<p>
	(The title of this post is a play on words starting from an adjective in Italian which translated into English does not lend itself to the play on words instead existing in a mixed mental language, in this 	case between Italian and English. It is the adjective “reflector”, in English, “retro-reflective”, “high-visibility”, or considering it a name, “reflector”, but also “cat’s-eye”. Hence the cat, that exists 	although only in English in the word in Italian but missing completely in the English translations of the word as an adjective reappearing instead in the translation of this as a name. Yes! There remained an 	“a” between “cat” and “refracting”, why not use the French preposition “à” (: on, by) to mix things up a little more?)<br><br>

	<h3>Born in Milan</h3>

  	<p>
	Nata ma cresciuta a Milano se non dalla fine fine dell’asilo a fino poco dopo aver raggiunto la maggiore età solo un fine settimana al mese o durante le festività, ci sono tornata per l’università e perché 	mi era chiaro che lì volevo trascorrere i miei anni formativi da giovane adulta. ripartendo più volte per le città che non potevo mancare. Da allora l’ho lasciata molte volte, ma sempre e solo per altre 	città che non potevo perdermi. Georgia on my mind diceva quello, Milan on mine, e così per sempre. Al momento sto cercandovi un minuscolissimo pied-à-terre molto “tac”, se avete da propormi qualcosa fatelo 	utilizzando il contact form qui – mica posso cercarmi le robe su airbb come una turista qualsiasi qualunque…<br><br>

	Born but raised in Milan after the end of the kindergarten and until shortly after I reached the age of majority only one weekend a month or during the bank holidays, my comeback there was officially due to 	the university, indeed it was clear that I wanted to spend my formative years as a young adult there. Since then I have left the city many times, although always only for other cities that I could not miss. 	Georgia on my mind Ray Charles said, Milan on mine, and so forever. At the moment I’m seeking there a very compact miniature of a pied-a-terre, a slick pad and if you have something to propose to me just do 	it using the contact form here 😉 you do not want to make me look for places on Airbnb like a tourist any…<br><br>

	<h3>Athanasius Kircher’s prophecy ft. some Italian reflections of mine on COVID-19</h3>

  	<p>
	Complotto senza plot, cospirazione che lascia spirare, poco sperare, sparire piuttosto, disperatamente, insperatamente nuovamente inspirare, semmai, spiraglio, spiritati brancolando dopo il tunnel le spire 	strette. Morire, dormire. Dopo il tunnel il ponte crollato, dopo il coma ricostruito. Le spirali burocratiche allentate, appalti bypassati, modello statuito. Si chiama Genova. In Liguria abbiamo un problema. 	Il basilico invenduto. In Sicilia, il traffico, diceva Johnny in un altro film. No, non è lo scudo penale evocato dal governatore regionale come lo spirito di una lentezza mediterraneamente nordica che di 	nordico ha poco se non il trend nel numero dei contagiati. Ma la Liguria è trasparente come le sue spiagge dimagrite. Mica come il Molise che non esiste e che a detta del governatore mediterraneamente 	nordico ha solo fiumare e spiagge di fiume. No, non è pervenuta nonostante indici di contagio da terza della classe, Rcon(0) anarchico come liguri teorici del Risorgimento. L’ira funesta contro i foresti, il 	popolo delle seconde case, il popolo delle pianure nonostante le colline, della nebbia assassina, loro in Liguria l’han sempre saputo che fossero solo di guai forieri. Ma ora, spostiamoci e partite. Ma 	prima, le nuove disposizioni nonostante le indisposizioni. Quali sintomi ha la sua di indisposizione? Anzi, mi dica semplicemente quanti. Non li legge i giornali? Basta così! Covid, dammi il tuo ID, eius, 	eo, id, eo, ciò, fammi vedere che devo co(n)dividere, anzi, senza con, solo dividere, et imperare, che imparino a con-vivermi, io da solo non ho vera vita, sono un parassita, un virus senza qualità, pura 	intenzione, riproduzione in autonomia, il mio sogno coronato, costernato di fronte ad un attacco pentastellato. Vis, roboris, che la forza sia con me, che sono letale, vi mando in ospedale.<br><br>

	Apocalittici o integrati, ora tutti disperati, nell’ora della verità. Saltano le categorie come i nervi, tutto ciò che è solido si dissolve nell’aria, questa considerazione marxiana non sfuggirà alla prova 	epidemiologica, fino a prova contraria, che tuttavia non lascerà che contrariati. Intanto abbassate la voce, ce ne sono i motivi, parlare alto produce più fiato, anche i felini, disturbati, se ne stiano 	schisci, che quando soffiano partecipano come i pollini a far girare i turbini. Salto di specie addomesticato. La Cina è micina. Non tirate loro la coda, tirate la corda no. Che si spezza, come l’incantesimo 	di un mondo fa. Che era almeno edulcorato, seppur non ci sia del tutto piaciuto. Il comune di Medicina, zona rossa in una regione rossa come la nota repubblica nientepopodimeno che dalla bandiera rossa; e 	gialla come la febbre. Che popolare sarà solo nei suoi sogni, ormai incubi di tutti. Dormire, forse sognare. La Cina è vicina, piuttostosìanzichéno. The Coming Race, viene da Agartha luogo elettivo del Re 	del Mondo, al Secolo – d’Italia o XIX? – Xi Jinping, pong.<br><br>

	All’oggi, del mercato la fine non è ancora in vista, come diceva uno che di postmoderno scriveva, è più probabile assistere alla fine del mondo che che alla fine del capitalismo. Nous n’avons jamais été 	modernes. A torto o ragione sono il primo virus postmoderno, costruito come un patchwork con genomi di virus già esistenti, ma mi muovo internamente ad una costellazione nuova di pacco. E Sta pandemia è 	proprio un pacco di proporzioni gigantesche che nemmeno Amazon ti recapita più – al momento si curano solo di prodotti medicali – una “sola” come dicono a Roma. Si vede si pensava che società 		dell’informazione coincidesse con il venir informati e per tempo.<br><br>

	E stiamo come d’autunno d’estate. The End of (Hi!)story and the Last Men, fa anch’esso parte delle letture vintage da consigliare a complottisti tra il 4.0 e il 5G.<br><br>

	<h3>Arm the armoured rhinoceros</h3>

  	<p>
	Like the Dürer’s rhinoceros – that died in a shipwreck in the Tyrrhenian Sea, precisely in the Spezia Gulf, transported from Portugal to Italy, this is instead very much alive, facing the Adria Sea in the     	Venetian Lagoon – he shares the same destiny of a sightseening animal, a wondreous. But better days are coming, days of revenge, better days for wondrous transformer rinoscheroses…
	“Un rinoceronte cammina la notte sull’acqua della Laguna torrendo parole al vento, in cerca di miglior fortuna si sfoga con la luna. La sua sagoma è fatta di lucido metallo, un giorno, presto capirà di aver 	preso un abbaglio, cosa sarà mai una recinzione, cosa sarà mai una nazione per l’animale più pesante del mondo, transformer di metallo per di più, quindi armato, darà seguito al suo destino già segnato, sì, 	di grandi viaggi, che non si scoraggi, armerà una flotta e inizierà la sua vera lotta, lo porterà lontano, molti gli daranno una mano, armata, che tremino già i codardi le cui retine verran trafitti dai 	dardi riflessi sulle lamine lucenti di questo rinoceronte transformer diretto discendente di quello detto del Dürer.”<br><br>

	<h3>Verso Lutetia</h3>

  	<p>

	Il treno di notte che è già giorno e già Francia dormiente <br>

	solo un corridore e me desti veramente <br>

	lui lungo la traiettoria dei binari <br>

	io rincorro giallo–blu scenari <br>

	lui delle mie impressioni più celere e celeste <br>

	io del suo sfuggirmi più Cerere e terrestre <br>

	Prima di Parigi, medio raggio lontana <br>

	la veduta di prima ancor notte e ancora più montana <br>

	Forse eran monti che manco eran colline <br>

	forse son lì solo non tutte le mattine <br>

	Meno dell’Italia mi pare aver la Francia <br>

	meno di che cosa dice già stizza di pancia <br>

	meno di niente meno di zero <br>

	infatti era un complimento <br><br>
